Instead, they open up meaningful conversations that show children that someone cares, and give children a chance to talk about problems and experiences.

                      methamphetamine, and other substances, withdrawal also has an emotional
                      component. Withdrawal from any opioid or alcohol may cause these emotional

                    <p class="card-text">Emotional abuse is a way to control another person by using emotions to criticize, shame, blame, or otherwise manipulate another person.

You probably know many of the more obvious signs of mental and emotional abuse. But when you’re in the midst of it, it can be easy to miss the persistent undercurrent of abusive behaviour. </p>

                      “We can control the panic before it fully sets in if we know the warning signs,” Rigney says. “While there are common ones to look out for, like shortness of breath and faster pulse, it can vary between people.”</p>
